# Demo
( run test.rb in console )
```shell
Append test: (t) -> (4) -> (1) -> (g) -> (test) -> nil
Prepend test: (start) -> (t) -> (4) -> (1) -> (g) -> (test) -> nil
List size: 6
List head: start
List tail: test
List contains 4? true
List contains -1? false
List index of 'g': 4
List index of 'abc': nil
Insert at 6 (-5):
(start) -> (t) -> (4) -> (1) -> (g) -> (test) -> (-5) -> nil
List pop test:
(start) -> (t) -> (4) -> (1) -> (g) -> (test) -> nil
Remove at 5:
(start) -> (t) -> (4) -> (1) -> (g) -> nil
